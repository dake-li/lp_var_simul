## Replication

### Main results

1. **Estimate IRFs from simulated data**: Run the following scripts to select 6000 DGPs (under observed-shock identification), repeat 5000 Monte Carlo simulations for each DGP, and apply multiple estimators for each simulation. This step produces the raw IRF estimates.

    - In [Settings/shared.m](DFM/Settings/shared.m), set ``settings.specifications.random_n_spec = 100``, and ``settings.simul.n_MC = 5000``.
    - In [run_dfm.m](DFM/run_dfm.m), first set ``estimand_type = 'ObsShock'``, ``lag_type = 4``, and ``mode_type = 1``.
    - After the setup above, run [run_dfm.m](DFM/run_dfm.m) 60 times, by varying the following, to iterate through 6000 DGPs:
      - ``dgp_type`` from ``'G'`` (for fiscal policy type) to ``'MP'`` (for monetary policy type);
      - ``spec_id`` from 1 to 30 (for 30 distinct seeds, where each seed draws 100 random DGPs).
    - Raw IRF estimates will be saved in the directory "DFM/Results/". (**Warning**: File sizes will be very large.)

2. **Summarize key statistics**: Run the following scripts to obtain summary statistics of raw IRF estimates across 5000 simulations. This step reduces the dimensionality of the results.

    - In [run_combine.m](DFM/run_combine.m), first set ``spec_id_array = [1:30]``, ``dgp_type = 'G'`` (or ``'MP'``). Additionally, specify ``estimand_type``, ``lag_type``, and ``mode_type`` to be consistent with Step 1.
    - Finally, run [run_combine.m](DFM/run_combine.m) once to summarize the 5000 simulations as 9 summary statistics for each DGP.
    - These summary statistics will also be saved in the directory "DFM/Results/".

3. **Properties of selected DGPs and true IRFs**: Run the following scripts to summarize the properties of the selected DGPs and their true IRFs (***Section 3.4***).

    - In [Reporting/run_plot_dgp.m](DFM/Reporting/run_plot_dgp.m), set ``mode_select = 1``, ``lags_select = 2``, and ``exper_select_group = {[2,5]}``.
    - Then run [Reporting/run_plot_dgp.m](DFM/Reporting/run_plot_dgp.m) to summarize selected DGPs (***Table 1***) and plot examples of true IRFs (***Figure 1***). (**Warning**: In ***Table 1***, the row "IV first stage F-statistic" will be computed in Step 5 below.)
    - Outputs are all saved in the directory "Reporting/fig/".

4. **Evaluate loss for observed-shock estimators**: Run the following scripts to show bias and variance profiles of each estimator under observed shock identification, and compare their loss at different bias weights and target horizons (***Sections 5.1-5.3***).

    - Always set ``mode_select = 1``, ``lags_select = 2``, and ``exper_select_group = {[2,5]}`` below.
    - Run [Reporting/run_plot_loss.m](DFM/Reporting/run_plot_loss.m) to get bias and variance profiles separately for each estimator (***Figures 2-3***).
    - Run [Reporting/run_plot_tradeoff.m](DFM/Reporting/run_plot_tradeoff.m) to get head-to-head loss comparison between two estimators (***Figures 4-5 and 7-9***).
    - Run the Jupyter Notebook [Reporting/plot_best_method.ipynb](DFM/Reporting/plot_best_method.ipynb) (with ``folder`` set to the output directory in Step 3), to depict the optimal estimator given different bias weights and target horizons (***Figure 6***).
    - Outputs are all saved in the directory "Reporting/fig/".

5. **Evaluate loss for IV estimators**: Run the following scripts to get bias and variance profiles for estimators under IV identification (***Figures 10-11***).

    - Redo Steps 1-4, but change ``estimand_type = 'IV'`` in Steps 1-2, and ``exper_select_group = {[1,4]}`` in Steps 3-4.

### Additional results in the online appendix

6. **Examples of estimated IRFs**: Run the following scripts to plot examples of IRF estimates, as in ***Appendix E***.

    - First finish Step 1.
    - Then in [Subroutines/run_plot_irf_estimate.m](DFM/Subroutines/run_plot_irf_estimate.m), set ``spec_id = 1``, ``dgp_type = 'G'``. Additionally, specify ``estimand_type``, ``lag_type``, and ``mode_type`` to be consistent with Step 1.
    - Run [Subroutines/run_plot_irf_estimate.m](DFM/Subroutines/run_plot_irf_estimate.m) to plot examples of IRF estimates (***Figures E.1-E.7***)
    - Outputs are saved in the directory "Results/".

7. **Further evaluations for IV estimators**: Run the following scripts to further examine bias and variance profiles of IV estimators, as in ***Appendix F.1***.

    - ***Figures F.1-F.2*** should have been generated in the outputs of Step 5.
    - For ***Figures F.3-F.4***, repeat Step 5, but specify ``DGP_select`` to 2 (low degree of invertibility) or 3 (high degree of invertibility) in [Reporting/run_plot_loss.m](DFM/Reporting/run_plot_loss.m).

8. **Robustness checks**: Run the following scripts to revisit the bias and variance trade-off in various extensions (***Appendices F.2-F.10***).

    - Each of the sub-steps below requires repeating Steps 1-4, but with slight adjustments.
    - Stationary DGPs (***Table F.1***, ***Figures F.5-F.7***): change ``mode_type = 6`` in Steps 1-2, and ``mode_select = 6`` in Steps 3-4.
    - Recursive identification (***Table F.2***, ***Figures F.8-F.10***): change ``estimand_type = 'Recursive'`` in Steps 1-2, and ``exper_select_group = {[3,6]}`` in Steps 3-4.
    - Salient observables (***Figures F.11-F.13***): change ``mode_type = 4`` in Steps 1-2, and ``mode_select = 4`` in Steps 3-4. (**Warning**: In Step 1, the code will not execute for sufficiently large values of ``spec_id``, since the total number of available DGPs is exhausted. Simply skip to the next step when this happens.)
    - 90th percentile loss (***Figures F.14-F.16***): change ``loss_quant = 0.9`` in Step 4.
    - Fiscal and monetary shocks (***Figures F.17-F.20***): change ``exper_select_group = {[2]}`` (to display fiscal shocks only) or ``exper_select_group = {[5]}`` (to display monetary shocks only) in Steps 3-4.
    - Longer estimation lag length (***Figures F.21-F.23***): change ``lag_type = 8`` in Steps 1-2, and ``lags_select = 3`` in Steps 3-4.
    - Smaller sample size (***Figure F.24-F.26***): change ``mode_type = 2`` in Steps 1-2, and ``mode_select = 2`` in Steps 3-4.
    - Larger sample size and estimation lag length (***Figures F.27-F.29***): change ``mode_type = 3`` and ``lag_type = 12`` in Steps 1-2, coupled with ``mode_select = 3`` and ``lags_select = 4`` in Steps 3-4.
    - More observables (***Figure F.30-F.32***): change ``mode_type = 5`` in Steps 1-2, and ``mode_select = 5`` in Steps 3-4. Also redo Step 5 for IV estimators.

9. **Splitting by variable categories**: ***Table F.3*** should have been generated in the outputs after finishing Steps 1-4 (***Appendix F.11***).
